## Concept
The concept of the book is to get people excited for programming artistic pieces. In this book we teach basic concepts that make up building blocks for interactive and potentially artistic programs. The focus is to help the reader to create creative software and to learn how to program such software. The artistic part is up to the reader, but we hope to give good starting points, where readers can bring in their creativity.

In parts we suggest critical reflection on creative coding and programming art pieces. In the lecture at LMU this is done as discussions, that are not captured in the book. We recommend readers to show their ideas and programs to other and discuss and defend it. This aids reflection and learning, similar to what we do in the course.

Besides the programming concepts and the implementation techniques, we discuss different topics, including: 
* How aesthetics can be programmed?
* Creativity vs. determined by algorithms?
* Creative information visualization vs. art? 
* Evolutionary systems and creativity?
* ...

### The Goal: an âˆž-Exhibition
In the course we create different interactive software programs. With the selection of the topics we try to cover many different programming concepts and implementation techniques. 

All the programs are designed to create changing new outputs, either after some time or based on user interaction. All programs together can then be set-up as an exhibition that is ever changing, which we call an $\infty$-Exhibition. If the screens with the software are set-up in a circle, where screens face outwards, a visitor of the exhibition can walk around an will always see new exhibits.

### Target Group and Expected Skills
The course and book is designed for readers studying at the intersection of art, media, and technology. We expect that readers have an interest in interactive art and that they want to improve their abilities to create interactive installations. 

We expect that readers have basic programming skills in processing. If readers have no programming skills at all, we suggest to do an introductory tutorial (e.g. https://processing.org/tutorials/ ). For readers with programming experience in another languages, we expect that they can follow the course and read up on processing details as they go along.
